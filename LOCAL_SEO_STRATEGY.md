# Local SEO Strategy for Icon Dumpsters

## Overview
This document outlines our comprehensive local SEO strategy using city-specific pages (subdirectories) to target local markets throughout Utah.

## Why Subdirectories Over Subdomains?

### ‚úÖ **Subdirectories (Recommended)**
- **Domain Authority Consolidation**: All pages share the main domain's authority
- **Better Link Juice Flow**: Internal links pass more value between pages
- **Easier Management**: Single domain, single analytics, single sitemap
- **Google's Preference**: Google treats subdirectories as part of the main site
- **Better for Local SEO**: Local signals are consolidated under one domain

### ‚ùå **Subdomains (Not Recommended)**
- **Separate Domain Authority**: Each subdomain starts from scratch
- **Split Link Equity**: Links don't pass value between subdomains
- **Complex Management**: Separate analytics, sitemaps, etc.
- **Poorer Local SEO**: Local signals are fragmented across domains
