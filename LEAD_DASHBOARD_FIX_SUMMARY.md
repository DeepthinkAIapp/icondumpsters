# ðŸŽ¯ Lead Dashboard Integration - FIXED!

## ðŸš¨ Problem Identified
The dashboard was showing "Leads: 0" and "No leads data available" even though we had generated 15 high-quality leads in the database.

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause Analysis
1. **API Path Issues**: The API endpoint was looking for the database in the wrong path
2. **Data Mapping Issues**: The dashboard wasn't properly mapping database fields to display fields
3. **API Integration**: The dashboard wasn't calling the leads API endpoint
4. **Data Refresh**: No automatic refresh after lead generation

## âœ… Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed API Endpoint** (`/api/scraper/leads/route.ts`)
- **Corrected Database Path**: Fixed path from `../scraper/` to `scraper/`
- **Direct Database Access**: Created Python script to read SQLite database directly
- **Proper Data Structure**: Returns leads with correct field mapping
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when database doesn't exist

### 2. **Enhanced Dashboard Integration** (`scraper-dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Dual API Calls**: Now calls both competitor and lead APIs
- **Data Combination**: Merges competitor and lead data properly
- **Field Mapping**: Maps database fields to display fields correctly
- **Auto Refresh**: Automatically refreshes data after lead generation

### 3. **Database Field Mapping**
- `contact_name` â†’ Name display
- `company_name` â†’ Company display  
- `phone` â†’ Phone display
- `address` â†’ Location display
- `lead_source` â†’ Source display
- `services` â†’ Type display
- `lead_score` â†’ Score display

## ðŸŽ¯ Results

### **Before Fix**
- Dashboard showed "Leads: 0"
- "No leads data available" message
- No lead data displayed
- API returning empty results

### **After Fix**
- Dashboard shows "Leads: 15" 
- All 15 leads displayed with full details
