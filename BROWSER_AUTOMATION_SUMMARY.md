# 🌐 Browser Automation System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What We've Built

I've created a comprehensive browser automation system that lets you **log in manually** to websites and then **automatically scrape data** using your authenticated sessions. This bypasses most blocking mechanisms because it appears as legitimate user activity.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### **1. Manual Login Process**
- Opens Chrome browser windows for you
- Navigates to the target website (Reddit, Craigslist, Yellow Pages)
- **You log in manually** using your real accounts
- System saves your login session (cookies) for future use

### **2. Automatic Scraping**
- Uses your logged-in session to scrape data
- Appears as normal user browsing
- Extracts leads automatically from the pages you navigate to
- Saves leads to your database

### **3. Session Management**
- Saves login cookies for each website
- Future runs automatically use your saved sessions
- No need to log in repeatedly

## 📁 Files Created
