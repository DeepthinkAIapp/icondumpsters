# How to Analyze Geographic & Time Patterns in Liberty Dumpster Leads

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step-by-Step Manual Analysis**

### **Step 1: Create Your Data Spreadsheet**

Use the lead tracking template I created, or create a simple spreadsheet with these columns:

```
Date | Time | Customer Name | Location | Zip Code | Project Type | Platform Used | Referral Code | Notes
```

### **Step 2: Geographic Pattern Analysis**

#### **A) Location Frequency Analysis**
1. **Count leads by location** - How many leads from each city?
2. **Calculate percentages** - What % of leads come from each location?
3. **Look for clustering** - Are most leads from 1-2 specific cities?

**Example Analysis:**
```
Salt Lake City: 15 leads (50%)
West Valley City: 8 leads (27%)
Provo: 4 leads (13%)
Orem: 3 leads (10%)
```

**What This Tells You:**
- âœ… **High clustering (50%+ from one city)** = Liberty may use local lead services
- âœ… **Even distribution** = Liberty may use broad lead aggregators
- âœ… **Specific zip codes** = Could be territory-based distribution

#### **B) Zip Code Analysis**
1. **Group by zip code** - Are leads from specific zip codes?
2. **Look for patterns** - Are they from adjacent areas?
3. **Check for exclusivity** - Do you get leads from specific territories?

**Example:**
```
84101: 8 leads (downtown SLC)
84119: 6 leads (West Valley)
84102: 4 leads (downtown SLC)
84601: 3 leads (Provo)
```

### **Step 3: Time Pattern Analysis**

#### **A) Day of Week Analysis**
1. **Count leads by day** - Which days do you get the most leads?
2. **Look for patterns** - Are leads concentrated on specific days?

**Example:**
```
Monday: 8 leads
Tuesday: 12 leads
Wednesday: 6 leads
Thursday: 10 leads
Friday: 4 leads
Saturday: 2 leads
Sunday: 0 leads
```

**What This Tells You:**
- âœ… **Weekday concentration** = Business-focused lead generation
- âœ… **Weekend leads** = Consumer-focused (HomeAdvisor, etc.)
- âœ… **Specific day patterns** = Automated distribution schedules

#### **B) Time of Day Analysis**
1. **Group by time slots** - When do leads come in?
2. **Look for peak times** - Are there specific hours with more leads?

**Time Slots:**
- **Early Morning (6-9 AM)**: Business hours, automated systems
- **Morning (9-12 PM)**: Peak business activity
- **Afternoon (12-5 PM)**: Standard business hours
- **Evening (5-9 PM)**: Consumer activity
- **Late Night (9 PM+)**: Automated systems

**Example:**
```
Morning (9-12 PM): 15 leads
Afternoon (12-5 PM): 12 leads
Evening (5-9 PM): 3 leads
Early Morning (6-9 AM): 2 leads
```

#### **C) Hourly Analysis**
1. **Count leads by hour** - Which specific hours are busiest?
2. **Look for patterns** - Are leads at consistent times?

**Example:**
```
9:00 AM: 5 leads
10:00 AM: 4 leads
11:00 AM: 3 leads
2:00 PM: 4 leads
3:00 PM: 3 leads
```

### **Step 4: Combined Pattern Analysis**

#### **A) Location + Time Patterns**
Look for these combinations:

**High-Value Patterns:**
- **Same location + same time** = Automated local distribution
- **Different locations + same time** = Centralized lead distribution
- **Same location + different times** = Local lead aggregator

**Example Analysis:**
```
Salt Lake City leads:
  - Morning: 8 leads
  - Afternoon: 4 leads
  - Evening: 3 leads

West Valley City leads:
  - Morning: 5 leads
  - Afternoon: 3 leads
  - Evening: 0 leads
```

#### **B) Platform + Location Patterns**
Analyze which platforms generate leads from which locations:

**Example:**
```
HomeAdvisor:
  - Salt Lake City: 8 leads
  - West Valley City: 3 leads

Google:
  - Salt Lake City: 4 leads
  - Provo: 2 leads

Yelp:
  - Salt Lake City: 3 leads
  - Orem: 1 lead
```

### **Step 5: Pattern Detection**

#### **A) Automated System Indicators**

**Geographic Clustering:**
- âœ… 40%+ of leads from one location
- âœ… Consistent zip code patterns
- âœ… Territory-based distribution

**Time Consistency:**
- âœ… 60%+ of leads at same time of day
- âœ… Consistent day-of-week patterns
- âœ… Regular hourly patterns

**Platform Consistency:**
- âœ… 70%+ of leads from one platform
- âœ… Consistent platform-location patterns
- âœ… Systematic referral codes

#### **B) Lead Aggregator Indicators**

**HomeAdvisor/Thumbtack Patterns:**
- âœ… Evening and weekend leads
- âœ… Consumer-focused project types
- âœ… Multiple locations, same platform

**Google Local Services Patterns:**
- âœ… Business hours leads
- âœ… "Near me" search terms
- âœ… Local geographic clustering

**Industry Network Patterns:**
- âœ… Business hours only
- âœ… Construction-focused projects
- âœ… Professional referral codes

### **Step 6: Interpretation Guide**

#### **What Different Patterns Mean:**

**Geographic Clustering + Time Consistency:**
- Liberty likely uses local lead services
- Automated distribution system
- Territory-based partnerships

**Even Distribution + Platform Consistency:**
- Liberty uses major lead aggregators
- HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, or similar
- Automated lead distribution

**Weekday + Business Hours:**
- B2B lead generation
- Industry networks
- Professional referral systems

**Evening + Weekend + Consumer Projects:**
- Consumer-focused aggregators
- HomeAdvisor, Angie's List
- DIY/home improvement networks

### **Step 7: Action Items Based on Patterns**

#### **If You Find Geographic Clustering:**
1. **Research local lead services** in those areas
2. **Contact local business directories**
3. **Look for territory-based partnerships**
4. **Consider expanding to those areas**

#### **If You Find Time Consistency:**
1. **Research lead aggregators** that operate at those times
2. **Look for automated distribution systems**
3. **Check for scheduled lead processing**
4. **Consider joining similar networks**

#### **If You Find Platform Consistency:**
1. **Research those specific platforms**
2. **Look for partnership opportunities**
3. **Consider direct platform membership**
4. **Analyze competitor presence on platforms**

### **Step 8: Documentation Template**

Create a summary document with your findings:

### **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Analysis**

1. **Track at least 20-30 leads** for meaningful patterns
2. **Use consistent time zones** when recording times
3. **Ask customers detailed questions** about their search journey
4. **Look for seasonal patterns** over several months
5. **Compare patterns to your other lead sources**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Quick Pattern Checklist**

**For Each Lead, Ask:**
- [ ] What city/zip code is the customer in?
- [ ] What day and time did the lead come in?
- [ ] What platform did they originally use?
- [ ] What search terms did they use?
- [ ] What type of project is it?
- [ ] Is there a referral code or tracking number?

**Pattern Indicators:**
- [ ] Geographic clustering (40%+ from one area)
- [ ] Time consistency (60%+ at same time)
- [ ] Platform consistency (70%+ from one source)
- [ ] Referral code patterns (similar codes)
- [ ] Project type consistency (similar projects)

This analysis will help you understand exactly how Liberty Dumpster sources and distributes leads, which will help you optimize your relationship with them and potentially find other lead sources!
