## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### **Pagination**
```typescript
// Shows 10 leads per page
const [itemsPerPage] = useState(10);
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);

// Calculates which leads to show
function getCurrentPageData() {
  const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * itemsPerPage;
  const endIndex = startIndex + itemsPerPage;
  return scraperData.leads.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
}
```

### **Selection System**
```typescript
// Tracks selected lead indices
const [selectedLeads, setSelectedLeads] = useState<Set<number>>(new Set());

// Toggle individual lead selection
function toggleLeadSelection(index: number) {
  const newSelected = new Set(selectedLeads);
  if (newSelected.has(index)) {
    newSelected.delete(index);
  } else {
    newSelected.add(index);
  }
  setSelectedLeads(newSelected);
}
```

### **Delete Functionality**
```typescript
// Deletes selected leads via API
async function deleteSelectedLeads() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/scraper/leads', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      action: 'delete_leads',
      leadIds: Array.from(selectedLeads)
    })
  });
  
  // Refreshes data after deletion
  await loadScraperData();
}
```
